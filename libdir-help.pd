#X text 75 37 libdir - loader for libraries adherent to the libdir
standard;
#X text 58 130 The 'libdir' loader is a Pd loader which supports the
libdir library format. The libdir library format aims to be a common
library format for Pd which works with objects written in any language
\, including Pd. This library format was designed to be easy to create
\, install \, and use. It should work when installed into the global
path (i.e. pd/extra) or when copied locally into a project folder.
It should work with objects written in any supported language (i.e.
binaries \, .pd \, and the various loaders like pdlua and tclpd). Also
\, starting with Pd 0.43 and Pd-extended 0.42 \, the Help Browser dynamically
builds itself based on the libraries that are installed.;
